Build a professional, clean, government-grade dashboard UI for a Digital Twin of a Mining Operation.
The page design should follow the same modern visual style as the attached Mining AI dashboard (blue top bar, white content cards, left sidebar).
This should look like a real operational control panel for mining engineers and sustainability officers.

🧱 Layout Structure
🔹 Overall Layout

Left sidebar for navigation (consistent with theme):

Dashboard

Predictive Maintenance

Digital Twin (active)

Environmental Impact

Renewable Energy

Reports

Settings

Top blue header bar with project name and icons for notifications/user profile.

Main white workspace with data cards, charts, and interactive controls.

🧭 Top Section: Page Header

Title: “Digital Twin – Real-Time Process Simulation”

Subtext: “Virtual model of crushing & grinding operations with AI-based optimization and sustainability tracking.”

⚙️ Left Panel – Parameter Controls

Create a vertical control card containing sliders and dropdowns for simulation inputs:

Parameter	Type	Range
Crusher Speed (RPM)	Slider	1000 – 4000
Mill Rotation Speed (RPM)	Slider	500 – 2000
Feed Rate (tons/hr)	Slider	50 – 500
Ore Hardness	Slider (1–10)	—
Grinding Media Size (mm)	Slider	10 – 100
Apply AI Optimization	Checkbox	—

Add a primary “Run Simulation” button at the bottom.
Below it, include a mini log console with animated text such as:

Running simulation…
AI model optimizing parameters…
Efficiency improved by 8.2 %

🏗️ Center Panel – Process Visualization

Display a simplified schematic of the mining plant:

Flow: Ore Input → Crusher → Mill → Conveyor → Output

Each block should use clean flat icons or vector graphics.
When parameters change:

Crusher and mill icons subtly animate (spin/speed change).

Conveyor flow lines pulse faster or slower.

Output glow intensity reflects system efficiency.

Below the schematic, show live status indicators:

Power Usage Indicator (green/yellow/red)

System Health (%)

Production Flow Active (ON/OFF)

📊 Right Panel – Metrics & AI Insights

Organize this as stacked white cards (same as screenshot style):

Metric Cards:

Energy Consumption: xxx kWh/ton

Equipment Efficiency: xx %

CO₂ Emission: x.x kg/ton

Throughput: xxx tons/hour

Ore Hardness Avg: x.x Mohs

Feed Moisture: x.x %

Each card includes:

Mini status arrow (up/down vs last run)

Color indicators (green = improved, red = worse)

Below metrics, add a chart area with two graphs:

Energy Efficiency Comparison – bar chart (Pre-AI vs AI-Optimized)

Energy & Efficiency vs Time – line chart with live updates

💡 AI Optimization Recommendations

Add a card like in the screenshot showing recommendation list with status tags:

“Reduce crusher speed by 5%” (Active)

“Increase grinding media size to 60 mm” (Monitoring)

“Maintain mill rotation speed near 32 RPM” (Active)

“Decrease feed rate slightly to improve throughput” (Monitoring)

Each line shows the benefit metric (e.g., Energy Saving +6%, Efficiency +4%).

🚨 System Alerts and Sustainability Impact

Two cards below charts:

Active System Alerts – list recent issues or warnings (e.g., “High CO₂ spike detected” / “Low mill efficiency”).

Performance & Sustainability Impact – short text + progress bars for goals like:

Energy Reduction Goal – 78% achieved

Emission Target – Stable

Circular Economy Index – 65%

🌍 Footer

Small line:

Developed under Sustainable Mining AI Program | This Digital Twin Prototype simulates real-time plant optimization using AI-driven analytics.

🧮 Simulation Behavior Logic

When a user changes a control or clicks Run Simulation:

Randomly update all metric values within realistic ranges.

Animate chart data refresh smoothly.

Update visual schematic speed/brightness.

Show one or two dynamic AI insights at a time.

Realistic value ranges:
Energy 150–600 kWh/ton | Efficiency 60–95 % | CO₂ 100–600 kg/ton | Production 100–700 tons/hr | Cost $30–120 per ton

🎨 Design Style (to match screenshot)

Theme: Clean blue-and-white industrial dashboard

Primary Color: #0B5ED7 (blue header/sidebar)

Cards: White with soft shadow, rounded edges

Typography: “Inter” or “Poppins” – clean and professional

Charts: Blue bars and green/red trend indicators

Icons: Flat minimal icons for equipment and metrics

Layout: Grid-based, ample padding, balanced white space

✅ Expected Outcome

End result should look like a real-world Digital Twin dashboard used by a government or industrial control center —
clean, data-driven, and ready for presentation or deployment as a prototype.
